//! FR-EMG-020: River trade emergence oracle.
//!
//! Validates that river trade infrastructure is emerging in the simulation —
//! confirming that settlements are establishing river trade routes and commerce.
//!
//! Measurement: product of citizen_count and building_count (proxy for settled population
//! with infrastructure capable of supporting river trade development patterns).
//! Threshold: ≥ 1 citizen AND ≥ 1 building after tick > 0 (real settlement infrastructure).
