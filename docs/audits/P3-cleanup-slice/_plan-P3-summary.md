# P3 plan

Status: `CODE-ONLY-no-spec` — 215 IDs across 74 epics

Distributed across 7 agents.

# Phase: CODE-ONLY-no-spec → COVERED (write spec) or remove

Each ID has source code (`code_refs`) but no spec/traceability reference
(`spec_refs: []`). These are orphaned code fragments — they exist but no
one wrote down what they're for.

## Option A: Write spec (preferred)
1. Open the source file at the listed `code_refs` paths.
2. Read the function/code to understand what it does.
3. Write a minimal spec doc at
   `docs/traceability/<id-lower>/<id-lower>-intent.md` (≤ 30 lines).
   Use existing spec files as templates — see
   `docs/traceability/fr-civ-brush-01/fr-civ-brush-01-intent.md`.
4. Add `// Covers: FR-XYZ` to the spec body so audit picks it up.
5. Tag the source file with `// FR-XYZ` comment too if not already.

## Option B: Delete orphaned code
1. If the code is unused / dead / only called by tests of equal orphan
   status, delete it.
2. Add a one-line note in `docs/audits/code-only-deleted.md` so we
   don't waste cycles later.

## Bias
- Default to Option A. Most FR-NFR-prefixed orphans are intentional.
- Default to Option B for FR-NFR-P/NFR-C/NFR-R/NFR-S etc. that look
  like generic categories without substance.
