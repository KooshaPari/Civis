Alright.
DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION & FERTILITY COLLAPSE DYNAMICS
(CivLab – Population, Aging, Human Capital, and Civilizational “Slow Death” Layer v1.0)
This layer is non-optional for a mega-sim. Demographics are a primary driver of:

growth ceilings

innovation rate

fiscal stress

war capacity

migration pressure

legitimacy and ideology shifts

“decline” without losing a war

It also ties directly to your earlier themes:

energy scarcity

housing/rent extraction

measurement tyranny

cultural evolution

hegemonic cycles

0) Design goals
Model how a region moves through:

high fertility/high mortality → lower mortality → fertility decline

population growth → stabilization → aging → possible decline

the fiscal + political consequences of dependency ratios

policy levers that can soften (not fully “solve”) fertility collapse

migration as a compensator

heterogeneity across subcultures and classes

No simplistic “more money = more babies.” It’s about security, housing, opportunity cost, norms, and expectations.

1) State variables (per region rrr)
1.1 Cohort structure
Population by age cohort:
Nr,t(a)for a=0..AN\_{r,t}(a) \\quad \\text{for } a = 0..ANr,t​(a)for a=0..A
Or coarse cohorts:

0–14 (children)

15–64 (working)

65+ (elderly)

1.2 Derived ratios
Dependency ratio:
DRr,t=Nr,t(0..14)+Nr,t(65+)Nr,t(15..64)DR\_{r,t} = \\frac{N\_{r,t}(0..14)+N\_{r,t}(65+)}{N\_{r,t}(15..64)}DRr,t​=Nr,t​(15..64)Nr,t​(0..14)+Nr,t​(65+)​
Working-age share:
WASr,t=Nr,t(15..64)Nr,tWAS\_{r,t} = \\frac{N\_{r,t}(15..64)}{N\_{r,t}}WASr,t​=Nr,t​Nr,t​(15..64)​
Median age mr,tm\_{r,t}mr,t​ (computed from cohorts).

2) Birth dynamics (fertility model)
Define fertility rate fr,tf\_{r,t}fr,t​ as a function of economic, cultural, and policy variables.
We want something that produces:

demographic transition (fertility declines as societies urbanize and educate)

possible collapse (fertility < replacement)

sensitivity to housing costs and instability

cultural inertia and cohort effects

2.1 Core fertility equation
fr,t=fmin⁡+(fmax⁡−fmin⁡)⋅σ(Zr,t)f\_{r,t} = f\_{\\min} + (f\_{\\max}-f\_{\\min}) \\cdot \\sigma(Z\_{r,t})fr,t​=fmin​+(fmax​−fmin​)⋅σ(Zr,t​)
Where Zr,tZ\_{r,t}Zr,t​ is the fertility “drive”:
Zr,t=α1⋅ChildSecurityr,t−α2⋅OpportunityCostr,t−α3⋅HousingBurdenr,t−α4⋅FuturePessimismr,t−α5⋅Urbanizationr,t+α6⋅ProFamilyNormr,t+α7⋅PolicySupportr,tZ\_{r,t} =

Interpretations

ChildSecurity: confidence that kids will survive and be supported (baseline rights helps here)

OpportunityCost: especially for educated populations; linked to wages and career paths

HousingBurden: rent/land costs, overcrowding risk

FuturePessimism: climate anxiety, war risk, instability

Urbanization: higher urban density typically lowers fertility

ProFamilyNorm: cultural axis

PolicySupport: childcare, parental leave, housing supply, subsidies

This captures the real drivers without pretending cash alone fixes it.

3) Mortality & health dynamics
Mortality declines with:

healthcare access

baseline rights

tech regime

low scarcity

Increases with:

climate damage

war

epidemics

poverty and stress

Define age-specific mortality hazard:
μr,t(a)=μ0(a)⋅(1+β1Sr,t+β2Dr,t+β3WarHarmr,t)⋅(1−β4HealthCapacityr,t)\\mu\_{r,t}(a) = \\mu\_0(a)\\cdot (1 + \\beta\_1 S\_{r,t} + \\beta\_2 D\_{r,t} + \\beta\_3 \\text{WarHarm}\_{r,t})\\cdot (1-\\beta\_4 \\text{HealthCapacity}\_{r,t})μr,t​(a)=μ0​(a)⋅(1+β1​Sr,t​+β2​Dr,t​+β3​WarHarmr,t​)⋅(1−β4​HealthCapacityr,t​)
Population update:
Nr,t+1(a+1)=Nr,t(a)⋅(1−μr,t(a))N\_{r,t+1}(a+1)=N\_{r,t}(a)\\cdot (1-\\mu\_{r,t}(a))Nr,t+1​(a+1)=Nr,t​(a)⋅(1−μr,t​(a))
Births fill cohort 0:
Nr,t+1(0)=fr,t⋅Nr,t(fertile ages)N\_{r,t+1}(0)=f\_{r,t}\\cdot N\_{r,t}(\\text{fertile ages})Nr,t+1​(0)=fr,t​⋅Nr,t​(fertile ages)

4) Human capital accumulation and cohort quality
Not all births are equal for future capacity. Model “cohort quality” Qr,tQ\_{r,t}Qr,t​:

education attainment

health

cognitive development

Qr,t+1=Qr,t+γ1EducationSpend+γ2HealthSpend−γ3Sr,t−γ4Inequalityr,tQ\_{r,t+1} = Q\_{r,t} + \\gamma\_1 \\text{EducationSpend} + \\gamma\_2 \\text{HealthSpend} - \\gamma\_3 S\_{r,t} - \\gamma\_4 \\text{Inequality}\_{r,t}Qr,t+1​=Qr,t​+γ1​EducationSpend+γ2​HealthSpend−γ3​Sr,t​−γ4​Inequalityr,t​
Workforce effective labor:
ℓr,teff=∑a=1564Nr,t(a)⋅Qr,t(a)⋅Participation(a)\\ell^{eff}\_{r,t} = \\sum\_{a=15}^{64} N\_{r,t}(a)\\cdot Q\_{r,t}(a)\\cdot \\text{Participation}(a)ℓr,teff​=a=15∑64​Nr,t​(a)⋅Qr,t​(a)⋅Participation(a)
This links demographics directly to growth and innovation.

5) Aging → fiscal stress → legitimacy crisis loop
As dependency ratio rises, the cost of:

pensions

healthcare

baseline rights

increases relative to working population.
Define fiscal strain:
FSr,t=ElderCostr,t+ChildCostr,tYr,tFS\_{r,t} = \\frac{\\text{ElderCost}\_{r,t} + \\text{ChildCost}\_{r,t}}{Y\_{r,t}}FSr,t​=Yr,t​ElderCostr,t​+ChildCostr,t​​
or per-worker burden:
FSr,tworker=ElderCost+ChildCostNr,t(15..64)FS^{worker}\_{r,t} = \\frac{\\text{ElderCost}+\\text{ChildCost}}{N\_{r,t}(15..64)}FSr,tworker​=Nr,t​(15..64)ElderCost+ChildCost​
Higher fiscal strain:

increases taxes or reduces services

increases intergenerational conflict

can increase inequality

can reduce legitimacy

Legitimacy update includes a demographic term:
Lr,t+1=Lr,t+⋯−η⋅FSr,tL\_{r,t+1} = L\_{r,t} + \\dots - \\eta \\cdot FS\_{r,t}Lr,t+1​=Lr,t​+⋯−η⋅FSr,t​
This is how “slow decline” happens even in peace.

6) Demography and war capacity
Mobilization capacity depends on working-age cohort size and willingness.
Define mobilizable manpower:
MPr,t=∑a=1845Nr,t(a)⋅Fitness(a)⋅Willingness(Cr,t,Lr,t)MP\_{r,t} = \\sum\_{a=18}^{45} N\_{r,t}(a)\\cdot \\text{Fitness}(a)\\cdot \\text{Willingness}(C\_{r,t}, L\_{r,t})MPr,t​=a=18∑45​Nr,t​(a)⋅Fitness(a)⋅Willingness(Cr,t​,Lr,t​)
Aging societies:

have smaller mobilizable pools

face higher domestic opposition to war

rely more on drones/automation (tech regime coupling)

This shapes hegemonic cycles: older hegemons get strategically brittle.

7) Migration as demographic valve
Migration flows are already in your model; now they interact with fertility and age structure.
Net migration MIGr,tMIG\_{r,t}MIGr,t​ shifts cohorts:
Nr,t+1(a)←Nr,t+1(a)+MIGr,t(a)N\_{r,t+1}(a) \\leftarrow N\_{r,t+1}(a) + MIG\_{r,t}(a)Nr,t+1​(a)←Nr,t+1​(a)+MIGr,t​(a)
Migration depends on:

wage/quality of life

tyranny exposure

climate damage

cultural assimilation friction

Add assimilation capacity:
Assimr,t=f(IntergroupTrust,InstitutionalCapacity,HousingSlack)Assim\_{r,t} = f(\\text{IntergroupTrust}, \\text{InstitutionalCapacity}, \\text{HousingSlack})Assimr,t​=f(IntergroupTrust,InstitutionalCapacity,HousingSlack)
Low assimilation:

increases polarization

can reduce legitimacy

can increase shadow exploitation of identity tension

8) Subculture fertility and polarization
Fertility is not uniform. Model at least 2–4 subpopulations per region:

urban high-skill

urban low-skill

rural/traditional

migrant group

Each has its own:

norms

housing burden

opportunity cost

trust levels

This produces realistic outcomes:

changing cultural composition over time

political realignment

education vs fertility tradeoffs

possible fragmentation

9) Policy levers (what players/AI can actually do)
You can’t “solve” fertility collapse cheaply, but you can influence it.
Levers:

housing supply expansion (reduces HousingBurden)

childcare subsidy (reduces OpportunityCost)

parental leave (reduces OpportunityCost)

education structure reforms (timing of career path)

baseline stability (reduces FuturePessimism)

immigration policy + integration investment (increases Assim)

automation strategy to offset labor shortages (tech regime link)

eldercare efficiency and preventive health (reduces ElderCost)

Each has costs and lag.

10) “Replacement” is not a target—stability is
In CivLab, the objective should not be “maximize population.”
It should be:

keep dependency ratio manageable

maintain effective labor supply via quality + automation

preserve legitimacy across generations

keep discretionary life high

This aligns with your hybrid ethics.

11) Attractors created by demography
This layer creates new long-run attractors:

High-skill low-fertility stable equilibrium

high quality labor, automation, stable but aging

Fertility collapse spiral

shrinking workforce → fiscal strain → legitimacy loss → brain drain → collapse

High-fertility low-capacity trap

young population but low human capital, instability risk

Migration-driven renewal

stability maintained via assimilation and inflows

Authoritarian pronatalism

coercive fertility policy raises tyranny and backfires culturally

Now you can simulate real-world demographic pathways.

12) UI requirements
Add demographic panels:

population pyramid over time

dependency ratio trajectory

fertility drivers breakdown (waterfall chart)

migration inflows/outflows by cohort

fiscal strain gauge

Citizen mode:

life expectancy changes

childcare access

housing affordability

“future optimism” indicator affecting family decisions

13) Integration with civilization progression
Demography influences regime transitions:

aging reduces growth and war capacity

low fertility increases reliance on automation/AI

high fertility with low quality increases instability

So tech regimes and demography must co-evolve:

automation becomes a demographic stabilizer but increases inequality risks

legitimacy depends on intergenerational fairness

Next logical layer (my pick)
To complete the “internal collapse” story alongside demography, the next spec should be:
Civil war, fragmentation, and secession dynamics — the internal version of hegemonic collapse, tied to ideology clustering, shadow networks, scarcity, and legitimacy.
Say “next” and we’ll formalize it at the same math depth.
