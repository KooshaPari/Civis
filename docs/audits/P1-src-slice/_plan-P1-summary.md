Status: `TEST-NO-CODE-REF` — 495 IDs across 109 epics

Distributed across 7 agents.

# Phase: TEST-NO-CODE-REF → COVERED

Each ID has a real test (`test_refs`) but no source file with a `// FR-XYZ`
comment (`code_refs: []`). Your job is to find the source function the test
exercises and add a single-line `// FR-XYZ` comment near its definition so
the audit picks it up as `code_ref`.

## Approach
1. Open the test file at the listed `test_refs` paths. Find what
   function/struct/method it calls.
2. Grep for the function definition in `crates/`. Common targets:
   `crates/<crate>/src/<module>.rs`.
3. Add `// FR-XYZ` comment on the line directly above the function/struct
   definition. Single-line comment, no doc comment needed.
4. Repeat for every ID in your slice.
5. `cargo build -p <crate>` after edits to catch syntax errors.
6. Commit with `test(<crate>): tag FR-XYZ on <brief summary>`.

## What counts as "code_ref"
- Any `fn`, `pub fn`, `pub struct`, `pub enum`, `pub trait`, `impl`,
  `const`, `static`, `mod` definition.
- Single-line `// FR-XYZ` above the item.
- Multiple FRs per file? Multiple comments are fine.

## Quality
- Don't change the source code itself. Only add the comment.
- Make sure you tag the *actual* function the test calls, not just any
  function in the file.
- If a test calls a public API across multiple modules, tag the entry
  point first.
